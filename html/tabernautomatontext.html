    <p>Greetings!</p>
    <p>in the next few days you will
        discover something interesting here. something very interesting and I think that you may like it
        you will like it so much that everyone you know will be the best of all things 
        it will be Vending Machines! that is the idea of tabernautomaton
    </p>
    <p>but have you see where they were when they new what they saw and how everything they saw was 
        what they wanted to see where all the things they thought they saw were images of what they 
        new they saw or what they think they were doing.
    </p>

    <p>I'm working on it! you will soon see an image of autonomous vending machines!</p>
    
    <p>Tabernautomaton: autonomous ghost kitchen food trucks</p>
    
    <p>autonomous ghost kitchen food trucks that operate like 
    a fleet of motherships and dropships</p>
    
    <p>autonomous ghost kitchen food trucks that operate like 
    a fleet of motherships and dropships, <br>the idea is to address 
    the lack of agility and lack of geographic coverage that existing 
    ghost <br>kitchens face as well as the long trip back problem that 
    human delivery workers face when <br>working in sparsely populated suburbs</p>
    
    <p>It's a system that I would find personally useful.</p>
